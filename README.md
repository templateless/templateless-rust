#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let content = Content::builder()
        .text("Hi, please **confirm your email**:")
        .button("Confirm Email", "https://your-company.com/signup/confirm?token=XYZ")
        .build()?;

    let email = Email::builder()
        .to(EmailAddress::new("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_EMAIL_ADDRESS>"))
        .subject("Confirm your signup üëã")
        .content(content)
        .build()?;

    let _result = Templateless::new("<YOUR_API_KEY>")
        .send(email)
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> üöß **The SDK is not stable yet.** This API might change as more features are added. Please watch the repo for the changes in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## üèó Debugging

You can generate _test API keys_ by activating the **Test Mode** in your dashboard. By using these keys, you'll be able to view your fully rendered emails without actually sending them to the intended recipients.

When you use a test API key in your SDK, the following output will appear in your logs when you try to send an email:

```log
Templateless [TEST MODE]: Emailed user@example.com, preview: https://tmpl.sh/ATMxHLX4r9aE
```

The preview link will display the email, but you must be logged in to Templateless to view it.

## üî≥ Components

Emails are crafted programmatically by making function calls. There's no dealing with HTML or drag-and-drop builders.

All of the following components can be mixed and matched to create dynamic emails:

<details>
  <summary>Text / Markdown</summary>

Text component allow you to insert a paragraph. Each paragraph supports basic markdown:

- Bold text: `**bold text**`
- Italic text: `_italic text_`
- Link: `[link text](https://example.com)`
- Also a link: `<https://example.com>`
- Headers (h1-h6):

  - `# Big Header`
  - `###### Small Header`

- Unordered list:

  ```md
  - item one
  - item two
  - item three
  ```

- Ordered list:

  ```md
  1. item one
  1. item two
  1. item three
  ```

```rust
Content::builder()
  .text("## Thank you for signing up")
  .text("Please **verify your email** by [clicking here](https://example.com/confirm?token=XYZ)")
  .build()?;
```

</details>
<details><summary>Link</summary>

Link component adds an anchor tag. This is the same as a text component with the link written in markdown:

```rust
Content::builder()
  .link("Confirm Email", "https://example.com/confirm?token=XYZ") // or...
  .text("[Confirm Email](https://example.com/confirm?token=XYZ)")
  .build()?;
```

</details>
<details><summary>Button</summary>

Button can also be used as a call to action. Button color is set via your dashboard's app color.

```rust
Content::builder()
  .button("Confirm Email", "https://example.com/confirm?token=XYZ")
  .build()?;
```

</details>
<details><summary>Image</summary>

Image component will link to an image within your email. Keep in mind that a lot of email clients will prevent images from being loaded automatically for privacy reasons.

```rust
Content::builder()
  .image(
    "https://placekitten.com/300/200",  // where the image is hosted
    Some("https://example.com"),        // [optional] link url, if you want it to be clickable
    Some(300),                          // [optional] width
    Some(200),                          // [optional] height
    Some("Alt text"),                   // [optional] alternate text
  )
  .build()?;
```

Only the `src` parameter is required; everything else is optional.

**If you have "Image Optimization" turned on:**

1. Your images will be cached and distributed by our CDN for faster loading. The cache does not expire. If you'd like to re-cache, simply append a query parameter to the end of your image url.
1. Images will be converted into formats that are widely supported by email clients. The following image formats will be processed automatically:

    - Jpeg
    - Png
    - Gif
    - WebP
    - Tiff
    - Ico
    - Bmp
    - Svg

1. Maximum image size is 5MB for free accounts and 20MB for paid accounts.
1. You can specify `width` and/or `height` if you'd like (they are optional). Keep in mind that images will be scaled down to fit within the email theme, if they're too large.

</details>
<details><summary>One-Time Password</summary>

OTP component is designed for showing temporary passwords and reset codes.

```rust
Content::builder()
  .text("Here's your **temporary login code**:")
  .otp("XY78-2BT0-YFNB-ALW9")
  .build()?;
```

</details>
<details><summary>Social Icons</summary>

You can easily add social icons with links by simply specifying the username. Usually, this component is placed in the footer of the email.

These are all the supported platforms:

```rust
Content::builder()
  .socials(vec![
    SocialItem::new(Service::Website, "https://example.com"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::Email, "username@example.com"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::Phone, "123-456-7890"), // `tel:` link
    SocialItem::new(Service::Facebook, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::YouTube, "ChannelID"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::Twitter, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::X, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::GitHub, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::Instagram, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::LinkedIn, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::Slack, "Org"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::Discord, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::TikTok, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::Snapchat, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::Threads, "Username"),
    SocialItem::new(Service::Telegram, "Username"),
  ])
  .build()?;
```

</details>
<details><summary>View in Browser</summary>

If you'd like your recipients to be able to read the email in a browser, you can add the "view in browser" component that will automatically generate a link. Usually, this is placed in the header or footer of the email.

You can optionally provide the text for the link. If none is provided, default is used: "View in browser"

**This will make the email public to anyone that has access to the link.**

```rust
Content::builder()
  .view_in_browser(Some("Read Email in Browser".to_string()))
  .build()?;
```

</details>

---

Components can be placed in the header, body and footer of the email. Header and footer styling is usually a bit different from the body (for example the text is smaller).

```rust
let header = Header::builder() // header of the email
  .text("Smaller text")
  .build()?;

let content = Content::builder() // body of the email
  .text("Normal text")
  .build()?;
```

Currently there are 2 themes to choose from: `Theme::Unstyled` and `Theme::Simple`

```rust
let content = Content::builder()
  .theme(Theme::Simple)
  .text("Hello world")
  .build()?;
```
