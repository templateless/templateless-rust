[Templateless](https://templateless.com) lets you generate and send transactional emails quickly and easily so you can focus on building your product.

## ✨ Features

- 👋 **Anti drag-and-drop by design** — emails are a part of your code
- ✅ **Components as code** — function calls turn into email HTML components
- 💻 **SDK for any language** — use your favorite [programming language](https://github.com/orgs/templateless/repositories)
- 🔍 **Meticulously tested** — let us worry about email client compatibility
- 💌 **Use your favorite ESP** — Amazon SES, SendGrid, Mailgun + more
- 💪 **Email infrastructure** — rate-limiting, retries, scheduling + more
- ⚡ **Batch sending** — send 1 email or 1,000 with one API call

## 🚀 Getting started

Install via Cargo:

```bash
cargo add templateless
```

Or add manually to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
templateless = "0.1"
```

## 👩‍💻 Quick example

This is all it takes to send a signup confirmation email:

```rust
use templateless::{Content, Email, EmailAddress, Templateless, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let content = Content::builder()
        .text("Hi, please **confirm your email**:")
        .button("Confirm Email", "https://your-company.com/signup/confirm?token=XYZ")
        .build()?;

    let email = Email::builder()
        .to(EmailAddress::new("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_EMAIL_ADDRESS>"))
        .subject("Confirm your signup 👋")
        .content(content)
        .build()?;

    let _result = Templateless::new("<YOUR_API_KEY>")
        .send(email)
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

> **Note**
> 🚧 **This SDK is not stable yet.** The API might change as more features are added. Please pay attention to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for breaking changes.

## 💌 Components

### Text

  Text component allow you to insert a paragraph. Each paragraph supports basic markdown:

  - Bold text: `**bold text**`
  - Italic text: `_italic text_`
  - Link: `[link text](https://example.com)`
  - Also a link: `<https://example.com>`
  - Header (h1-h6): `# Header`

  ```rust
  Content::builder()
    .text("**Verify your email** by [clicking here](https://example.com/confirm?token=XYZ)")
    .build()?;
  ```

### Link

  Link component adds an anchor tag. This is the same as a text component with the link written in markdown:

  ```rust
  Content::builder()
    .link("Confirm Email", "https://example.com/confirm?token=XYZ")
    .build()?;
  ```

### Button

  Button can also be used as a call to action. Button color can be controlled via your dashboard by setting the app's theme color.

  ```rust
  Content::builder()
    .button("Confirm Email", "https://example.com/confirm?token=XYZ")
    .build()?;
  ```

### Image

  Image component will link to an image within your email.

> **Note**
> Keep in mind that a lot of email clients will prevent images from being loaded automatically for privacy reasons.

  ```rust
  Content::builder()
    .image(
      "https://example.com/image.jpg",  // where the image is located
      Some("https://example.com"),      // [optional] link url, if you want it to be clickable
      Some(200),                        // [optional] width
      Some(100),                        // [optional] height
      Some("Alt text"),                 // [optional] alternative text
    )
    .build()?;
  ```

  Only the `src` parameter is required; everything else is optional.

  **If you have "Image Optimization" turned on:**

  1. Your images will be cached and distributed by our CDN for faster loading. The cache does not expire. If you'd like to purge cache, simply append a query parameter to the end of your image url.
  1. Images will be automatically converted into formats that are widely supported by email clients. The following image formats will be processed:

      - Jpeg
      - Png
      - Gif
      - WebP
      - Tiff
      - Ico
      - Bmp
      - Svg

  1. Maximum image size is 5MB for free accounts and 20MB for paid accounts.
  1. You can specify `width` and/or `height` if you'd like (those parameters are optional). Keep in mind that images will be scaled down to fit with the email theme if they're too large.

### One-Time Password

  OTP component is designed for showing temporary passwords and reset codes.

  ```rust
  Content::builder()
    .text("Here's your **temporary login code**:")
    .otp("XY78-2BT0-YFNB-ALW9")
    .build()?;
  ```

### Social Icons

  Every theme comes with easily linkable social icons to connect with your company's profiles.

  These are all the supported platforms:

  ```rust
  Content::builder()
		.socials(vec![
			SocialItem::new(Service::Website, "https://example.com"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::Email, "username@example.com"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::Phone, "123-456-7890"), // `tel:` link
			SocialItem::new(Service::Facebook, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::YouTube, "ChannelID"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::Twitter, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::X, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::GitHub, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::Instagram, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::LinkedIn, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::Slack, "Org"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::Discord, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::TikTok, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::Snapchat, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::Threads, "Username"),
			SocialItem::new(Service::Telegram, "Username"),
		])
    .build()?;
  ```

### View in Browser

  If you'd like your recipients to be able to read the email in a browser, you can add the "view in browser" component that will automatically generate a link.

  > **Note**
  > This will make the email public to anyone that has access to the link.

  ```rust
  Content::builder()
    .view_in_browser("Read Email in Browser")
    .build()?;
  ```
